-* add match url before running the Neural Net in evaluate stage
- Run different setting and find the one best? Try to detect is the problem could be solvec by the model? OK, it is solable, still need to try more
- check different activation function, different number of bigram filter, net structure
- Classifier: Better switch between train and evaluate mode, don't load whole data when evaluate, since it would not be used
- Change the evaluation, predict and get the the document wiht highest score
- Change the loss funtion, somehow present directly the problem
- Run different setting and find the one best??
- Have time, add function fake data to data_provider, since get reall data often take long time, while we need check many thing work with correct shape of the inpub
